### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

> I am currently studying [computer science: games engineering](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/informatik-games-engineering-bachelor-of-science-bsc/) at TUM in Munich, Germany. Apart from directly related fields like computer graphics or game physics, I am also interested in the user interaction aspect that is tackled by game development as a vital part of general software development.

- **Currently, I am working** on some notes and summaries related to the things I am learning so, on one hand, I can look through them everywhere on my phone and also that anybody who might find them useful can see the notes or even contribute

- **I am planning to** work on another unity game since there are a lot more possibilities than we thought or had time to work on when we made our first [university project](https://github.com/robin-weiland/EIGE-Project) in the said game engine, which was even featured on the faculties [Demo Day](https://www.in.tum.de/fuer-studierende/bachelor-studiengaenge/informatik-games-engineering/aktivitaeten/demo-day/).

> Although the above-mentioned points have little to do with it, a language I have a lot of experience with is python
> - I made a blender addon with which, multiple artists can leave todos and notes for others within a .blend file
